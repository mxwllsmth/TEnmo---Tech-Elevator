# TEnmo - Venmo mimic application

Pair programmed a command line application to mimic the functionality of venmo.

This applicaton was completed using the following technologies:

PostgreSQL  |  Java  |  JUnit  |  IntelliJ  |  Postman  |  pgAdmin 4

The goal of this project was to mimic the functionality of venmo by creating a service where a user can request or send money, their transaction will be recorded in a 
database, and their account balances will be updated accordingly.

This project was completed with a five-day time restriction in a team of two.

My teams code for this project includes a RESTful API server and a backend client.
